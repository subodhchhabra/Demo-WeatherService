# Big Compute: Weather Forecast as a Service on Windows Azure#

## Demo ##

### Introduction ###

Demos are sets of step-by-step guides only to help you demonstrate key Windows Azure's Big Compute Scenario. Each demo provides instructions and speaking points to guide you through the process of presenting the demo to others.

In this demo you will start with the [Weather Service](http://weatherservice.cloudapp.net/) Live Demo Site that allows you to run a forecast for the next 3 days.

> **Note:** Please follow the demo script carefully.  Each forecast simulation is compute intensive, and will run for 8 hours or more.
